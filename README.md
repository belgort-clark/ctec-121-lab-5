This exercise will have you use a Python program that is provided to you. The program will require you to use your student email account. 

**NOTE**: You may receive a warning from the code and an email that is sent to you by Google. If for some reason you encounter an error, please follow the instructions provided.

To update your GMail account security temporarily, [go to this page](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255?hl=en). Be sure to change the secruty setting back after you complete the lab.

## Python Code

You will find the code that you need to use for this lab in this repository.

## Submission

There is nothing you need to turn in for this problem. I will use the email you sent me using the program to enter the points for this problem.

Since you are using one of my repos, you won't have access to push anything back to GitHub. This is so you don't accidentally push your GMail username and password info back up to GitHub. Make sense?
